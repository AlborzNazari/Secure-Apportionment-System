## What It Does

This system takes a CSV file of political parties and their vote counts, then fairly distributes a given number of parliamentary seats using the Huntington-Hill method — the same method used in the U.S. House of Representatives. Results are encrypted with AES-256 before being saved to disk, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip

> **Windows users:** Do NOT use the Microsoft Store version of Python. Download the official installer from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads) and check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlborzNazari/Secure-Apportionment-System.git
cd Secure-Apportionment-System
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the root dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** The backend `requirements.txt` includes both `Flask` and `FastAPI`. The current application uses Flask. FastAPI and uvicorn are listed for future API development but are not required to run the app today.

---

## Preparing Your Input CSV

The system requires a CSV file with exactly two columns: `Group` and `Votes`.

**11 ready-made research scenarios are already included** in the project root
and embedded in the web interface dataset library — no file creation needed:

| File | Scenario | Seats |
|---|---|---|
| `sample_basic.csv` | 4-party proportional baseline | 100 |
| `sample_proportional.csv` | EU Parliament 22-state model | 705 |
| `sample_condorcet.csv` | Condorcet winner scenario | 50 |
| `sample_arrow.csv` | Arrow's impossibility stress test | 25 |
| `sample_runoff_round1.csv` | Two-round system Round 1 | 200 |
| `sample_runoff_round2.csv` | Two-round system Round 2 | 200 |
| `sample_strategic_voting.csv` | IIA violation — Green present | 60 |
| `sample_strategic_voting_no_green.csv` | IIA baseline — Green withdrawn | 60 |
| `sample_large_election.csv` | UK-scale 8.24M ballot test | 650 |
| `sample_alabama_paradox.csv` | Alabama paradox — try 25 then 26 | 25/26 |
| `sample_coalition.csv` | Bundestag coalition model | 598 |

To create your own CSV, save it with exactly this format:
```
Group,Votes
Party_A,50000
Party_B,30000
Party_C,15000
Party_D,5000
```

> **Windows PowerShell users:** Do NOT use `echo` to create CSV files — it adds
> invisible Unicode characters that break the parser and return empty results `{}`.
> Use Notepad or run:
> ```powershell
> Set-Content -Path "sample_data.csv" -Value "Group,Votes`nParty_A,50000`nParty_B,30000`nParty_C,15000`nParty_D,5000" -Encoding UTF8
> ```

**CSV rules:**
- First row must be the header: `Group,Votes`
- Group names must not contain commas
- Vote values must be whole positive numbers (no decimals)
- Rows with invalid values are silently skipped

## Running the Application

> **Recommended:** Use Docker (Option 1) — it eliminates all environment setup, works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and keeps your encryption key out of the project directory.

### Option 1 — Docker (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

**Step 1 — Clone and enter the project:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlborzNazari/Secure-Apportionment-System.git
cd Secure-Apportionment-System
```

**Step 2 — Create your environment file:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then open `.env` and set a real encryption key. Generate one with:
```bash
python -c "import os, base64; print(base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())"
```

**Step 3 — Build and start:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Step 4 — Open the web interface:**

Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

Upload your CSV and enter the number of seats. That's it.

## Windows Desktop App (No Setup Required)

For users who want to run the system without Python, Docker, or any
installation:

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/AlborzNazari/Secure-Apportionment-System/releases)
2. Download `ApportionmentSys-Windows.zip`
3. Unzip it anywhere on your machine
4. Double-click `ApportionmentSys-App.exe`
5. Select a dataset from the dropdown
6. Enter the number of seats
7. Click **Calculate Allocation →**

Results appear instantly in the output panel. Encrypted output saved
to `results.json.enc` in the same folder. No Python, no Docker, no
browser, no internet connection required.

> **Note:** Windows Defender or antivirus software may flag the exe
> on first run — this is a known false positive with PyInstaller
> bundles. Click "More info" → "Run anyway" to proceed. The source
> code is fully open at the link above.

**Useful Docker commands:**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose up --build` | Build image and start the app |
| `docker-compose up -d` | Start in background (detached) |
| `docker-compose down` | Stop and remove the container |
| `docker-compose logs -f apportionment` | Stream live logs |
| `docker-compose exec apportionment bash` | Open a shell inside the container |

**Running the CLI inside Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose exec apportionment python -m src.main --seats 10 sample_data.csv
```

> **Note:** Log files are written to a `logs/` directory mounted as a Docker volume. They persist across container restarts, which matters for audit trails on a security-critical application.

---

### Option 2 — Command Line (CLI)

Run from the **project root** directory (not from inside `src/` or `backend/`):

```bash
python -m src.main --seats 10 sample_data.csv
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `csv_file` | Yes | Path to your CSV file |
| `--seats` | Yes | Total seats to allocate |
| `--output` | No | Output filename base (default: `results.json`) |

**Example with custom output name:**
```bash
python -m src.main --seats 100 sample_data.csv --output election_results
```

**Expected output:**
```
Apportionment Results:
{'Party_A': 50, 'Party_B': 30, 'Party_C': 15, 'Party_D': 5}
Encrypted results saved to results.json.enc
Key saved to key.bin (keep secure!)
```

**Output files generated:**
- `results.json.enc` — AES-256 encrypted results
- `key.bin` — Encryption key (keep this secure; do not commit to Git)

### Option 3 — Web Interface (Flask, manual)

Run from the **project root**:

```bash
python -m src.app
```

Then open your browser and go to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

Upload your CSV file through the web form and enter the total number of seats to allocate.

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Known Issues & Bugs

**1. Empty results `{}` from CLI**

If you see `Apportionment Results: {}`, your CSV was not parsed correctly. This is almost always caused by PowerShell adding a UTF-16 BOM or extra formatting when creating the file with `echo`. Use `Set-Content` with `-Encoding UTF8` instead (see CSV section above).

**2. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`**

You are running the script from inside `src/` or `backend/`. Always run from the project root:
```bash
cd Secure-Apportionment-System
python -m src.main ...
```

**3. `app.py` imports `allocate_seats` which does not exist**

`src/app.py` imports `from src.apportionment import allocate_seats`, but the actual function in `apportionment.py` is named `huntington_hill`. Running `app.py` will raise an `ImportError`. Fix by updating the import in `app.py`:
```python
from src.apportionment import huntington_hill as allocate_seats
```

**4. `key.bin` and `results.json.enc` committed to Git**

These files are generated at runtime and should not be in version control. Add them to `.gitignore`:
```
key.bin
*.enc
logs/
```

**5. Default encryption key warning**

If `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is not set in your environment, the system uses a hardcoded default and prints a warning. For any real use, set the key in a `.env` file:
```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-random-secret-key-here
```

## Docker Troubleshooting

### `failed to connect to the docker API at npipe`
Docker Desktop is not running. Open it from the Start menu, wait for the green
**Running** status in the bottom-left corner, then retry in a fresh PowerShell window.
If it won't start, right-click → **Run as administrator**.
If the engine still fails after 60 seconds: Docker Desktop → Settings →
**Troubleshoot** → **Reset to factory defaults**.

### Changes to files not appearing in the browser
Docker caches image layers. Always use the full rebuild sequence:
```powershell
docker-compose down
docker rmi secure-apportionment-v010 -f
docker-compose up --build
```
Then hard-refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
Verify in browser console (F12): should say `✓ Secure Apportionment System v3 loaded`

### `ImportError: cannot import name 'allocate_seats'`
In `src/app.py` line 4, change:
```python
from src.apportionment import allocate_seats
```
to:
```python
from src.apportionment import huntington_hill as allocate_seats
```

### `TemplateNotFound: index.html`
In `src/app.py`, change:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
to:
```python
app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='../templates', static_folder='../static')
```

### `cp` not recognized on Windows
Use `copy` instead:
```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

### Annotations not showing in results panel
Open F12 → Console. If it says `v2 loaded` the image is stale — run the full
rebuild sequence above. Annotations only appear for the 11 named scenario files
or when selecting a card from the dataset library. Custom CSV uploads show results
without annotations by design.

## Deployment Targets

| Method | Platform | Requirements | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ApportionmentSys-App.exe` | Windows | Nothing | End users, offline use |
| `python -m src.main` | Any | Python 3.10+ | Developers, scripting |
| `docker-compose up --build` | Any | Docker Desktop | Full web UI, localhost |
| Fly.io / Render | Cloud | Docker | Public deployment (v0.2.0) |
| `./ApportionmentSys-linux` | Linux | Nothing | Linux end users |

Each deployment method is independent. The exe, Docker, and direct
Python all use the same core algorithm and encryption layer.

## Security Notes

- The `key.bin` file contains your AES-256 encryption key. Never commit it to a repository.
- In production, store the encryption key as an environment variable (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`), not in a file.
- Logging is configured to never record sensitive data.
- The system is intended for development and research use. A production deployment would require additional hardening (HTTPS, key management infrastructure, authentication).
